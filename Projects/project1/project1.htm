<hr>

<h2>Questions:</h2>

<ol>
	<li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>
	
	<li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
		
	<li>Does this site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
	
	<li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</li>
	
	<li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?</li>
	
	<li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>
	
	<li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?</li>
	
	<li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?</li>
	
	<li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes? (responsive design)?</li>
	
	<li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Website Critique - End of The World 2012</h2>
<h4><a href="http://www.endoftheworld2012.net/">www.endoftheworld2012.net</a></h4>
<ol>
		<li>My first impression of the site was that it looked very simple and older.</li>
		<li>The site organizes the information with links in the middle of the page.</li>
		<li>The site structure is very simple and straightforward, so it makes sense from a navigational point of view.</li>
		<li>The graphics are very minimal. The design on the side draws your attention to the links in the middle and the pages that the links take you include graphics that help you see where those other links can take you.</li>
		<li>Loading was very quick and very reasonable with how simple the site is.</li>
		<li>Everything was readable and well-balanced with the color scheme.</li>
		<li>There was no navigation bar, just links which can look like a navigational bar.</li>
		<li>Yes, the site had a color scheme and was repeated on all pages.</li>
		<li>The site responded well to smaller window sizes.</li>
		<li>I think the site kept everything very simple and minimal, which you don't find much of anymore.</li>
