    Ted and Betty Russon have been happily married for 30 years.  They look back on their honeymoon at Arches National Monument with great fondness.  They have tried to keep the same spice in their marriage as they found on their honeymoon. This amazing couple make it a practice to try out new extreme sports together, just for the fun of it.

</p>

<p>Their own honeymoon consisted of a wild mountain biking adventure in the beautiful slick red rock near Moab, Utah and through Arches National Monument.  On this same trip they also spent 3 days white water rafting down the Colorado River.

<blockquote>

<p>Wild Thing Magazine, August 2012:</p><img src="Images/iStockParaglideSm.jpg" alt="Paragliding" width="200" height="150" class="thumbnailright">

<p>"If you believe the saying, you only get married once, then you will want to make your honeymoon a memorable experience.  Extreme Honeymoons can help the couple that screams together, stay together.  They will expertly plan every step of your unforgetable trip so that all you will have to do is just survive.  According to Ted Russon, the founder of Extreme Honeymoons, "What else would you want to do on your honeymoon?  Some of the wild things they could plan for you include: kayaking on the Colorado River, bungee Jumping at Flaming Gorge Dam, bareback riding in the Bryce Canyon Rodeo, and an ATV safari across the Great Western Trail."

</p>

<p>Utah Brides Magazine, May 2012:</p>

    

<p>"Brides-to-be might worry that their honeymoon may be a forgetable experience. If you think a candle lit dinner sounds boring and you have seen one too many movies, then consider an Extreme Honeymoon.  Let Ted Russon's Extreme Honeymoons plan all the details of a wild and crazy honeymoon adventure. These reasonable priced tours are totally safe and an insurance policy is included with the cost of all packages.  One recent newlywed breathlessly related this experience,"Like, it was the most awesome experience of my life!"  So surprise your new spouse with a white-knuckle honeymoon."
